Stimulate at frame ~83
For analyzing spikes in "control" sets of trials:
	"Control" set = only 1 stim, can be 100 or 200 uA
	Baseline correction and measure windows both set to 80 and 40
	RLI division on, data inverse on, Nor2Array max off
	T-filter on binomial8, S-filter on 1
For determining background / initial SNR cutoff:
	Baseline correction window still set to 80 and 40
	Measure window now set to 20 and 40
	Cutoff = 95th percentile SNR
	Remove all pixels with SNR <= cutoff (step 1)
For analyzing second spikes:
	Baseline correction still set to 80 and 40
	If IPI = 20: measure window set to 120 and 40
	If IPI = 50: measure window set to 180 and 40
	If IPI = 100: measure window set to 280 and 40
To be included in data set, slice must have at least 5 ROIs
Visual files show what human eyes think of a trace:
	1 if trace does seem like a "real" spike
	0 if trace does not seem like a "real" spike
Trace photos:
	Check mark if included (1 in visual file)
	X if excluded (0 in visual file) because can't see spike
	M if excluded (0 in visual file) because looks like multiple cells
	For paired-pulse, if first pulse is M then second must also be M
	For paired-pulse, second pulse cannot be M if first is not M
Rotation photos:
	Translate all photos with X = between 0-150, y = 0
	Rotation angle clockwise (same direction turns in imageJ)
	Rotate so that L2/3 is on top
	Save both fluor and DIC image to see if angle looks good in both
