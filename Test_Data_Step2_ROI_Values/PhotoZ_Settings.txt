For analyzing spikes in "control" sets of trials:
	"Control" = all sets where only 1 stim, can be 100 or 200 uA,
		includes sets not explicitly marked "control"
	Baseline correction and measure windows both set to 90 and 40
	RLI division on, data inverse on, Nor2Array max off
	T-filter on binomial8, S-filter on 1
For determining background / initial SNR cutoff:
	Set measure window to 20 and 40
	Baseline correction still set to 90 and 40
	Cutoff = 95th percentile SNR
	Remove all pixels with SNR <= cutoff (step 1)
For analyzing second spikes:
	If IPI = 10: measure window set to 110 and 40
	If IPI = 20: measure window set to 130 and 40
	If IPI = 50: measure window set to 190 and 40
	If IPI = 100: measure window set to 290 and 40
To be included in data set, slice must have at least 5 ROIs
Visual files show what human eyes think of a trace:
	1 if trace does seem like a "real" spike
	0 if trace does not seem like a "real" spike
	Mark folder as "notUsable" if stim1 and < 5 ROIs with visual = 1
Trace photos:
	Check for M only in "control" trials, then apply to all others
		such that if M in "control" then M in all others and 
		no M in others if not in "control"
	Check mark if included (1 in visual file)
	X if excluded (0 in visual file) because can't see spike
	M if excluded (0 in visual file) because looks like multiple cells
	For paired-pulse, if first pulse is M second must also be M or X
	For paired-pulse, second pulse cannot be M if first is not M
Rotation photos:
	Translate all photos with X = between 0-150, y = 0
	Rotation angle clockwise (same direction turns in imageJ)
	Rotate so that L2/3 is on top
	Save both fluor and DIC image to see if angle looks good in both
For ACC, must have DIC image to find boundary between layers
Rotation_distances = euclidean distance, x component and y component
	for each ROI for unrotated (original) image
Rotation_shifted_distances = euclidean distance, x component and y
	component for each ROI for rotated image (so that cortical
	layers are parallel to X axis
Latency = half-amp latency
Amplitude = max amp (not just amplitude)
For data collected before stim was fixed (10-26-2020 and earlier) use
	46.5 msec (frame 93) as "stimulation point" when calculating
	latency or making pictures of traces
For calculating latency: 
	Data from 05-28-2020 through (including) 10-29-2020 had bug; 
		stimulation shown at frame 100 but actually stimulated
		7 (?) frames earlier
	Data from 12-13-2020 and later; no bug - stim at frame 98
