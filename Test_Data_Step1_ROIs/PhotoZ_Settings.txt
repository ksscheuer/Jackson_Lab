Stimulate at frame ~96
For analyzing spikes in "control" sets of trials:
	"Control" = all sets where only 1 stim, can be 100 or 200 uA,
		includes sets not explicitly marked "control". If only one
		set used as control, can't be 20 x 10, 30 x 10 etc (but
		*can* be 10 x 10) so that trials used for correlation 
		analysis not used as baseline controls
	Baseline correction and measure windows both set to 90 and 40
	RLI division on, data inverse on, Nor2Array max off
	T-filter on binomial8, S-filter on 1
For determining background / initial SNR cutoff:
	Set measure window to 20 and 40
	Baseline correction still set to 90 and 40
	Cutoff = 95th percentile SNR
	Remove all pixels with SNR <= cutoff (step 1)
For analyzing second spikes:
	If IPI = 20: measure window set to 130 and 40
	If IPI = 50: measure window set to 190 and 40
	If IPI = 100: measure window set to 290 and 40
