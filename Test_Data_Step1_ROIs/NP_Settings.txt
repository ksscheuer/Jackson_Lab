Stimulate at frame ~83
For analyzing spikes in "control" sets of trials:
	"Control" set = only 1 stim, can be 100 or 200 uA
	Baseline correction and measure windows both set to 80 and 40
	RLI division on, data inverse on, Nor2Array max off
	T-filter on binomial8, S-filter on 1
For determining background / initial SNR cutoff:
	Baseline correction window still set to 80 and 40
	Measure window now set to 20 and 40
	Cutoff = 95th percentile SNR
	Remove all pixels with SNR <= cutoff (step 1)
For analyzing second spikes:
	Baseline correction still set to 80 and 40
	If IPI = 20: measure window set to 120 and 40
	If IPI = 50: measure window set to 180 and 40
	If IPI = 100: measure window set to 280 and 40
To be included in data set, slice must have at least 5 ROIs
